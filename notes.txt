ToDo:

Done: 

// for loop of the list then if rook add it and add 1 to the count and repete and then repeate all of this for each piece

for i length of 7                                                                      
    iterate throught the map 
        if string == char of map  || string1 but capitilized == char of map
            Pieces[i][count]
            store x and y aswell as the colour depending of if it is a capital letter
            count +=1

        count = 0



this would work if we can change  the string as well during the loop. 

we can do ^ with a list of charictors with the name of the pieces. SO ['r,'b' ... ] but i dont like that idea as i dont think it is good enough as the list is used just onced but i cound use the original iteration of 7 as it to call it.
